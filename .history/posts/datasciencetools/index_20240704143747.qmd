Have I been taught the industry standard for data visualization?

Throughout my college experience I've been taught to visualize data through Python Libraries, R, Excel, Power BI







- Excel
- Looker
- Sisense
- Tableau
- Power BI 
- QlikView/Qlik Sense
- SAS Visual Analytics
- R packages (ggplot2, Shiny, Plotly)
- Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Google Data Studio (Google Analytics, Google Sheets)

I looked up 100 data analyst jobs on indeed, what tools do they use?
