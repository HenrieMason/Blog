Have I been taught the industry standard for data visualization?

Throughout my college experience I've been taught to visualize data through Python Libraries, R, Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI, but did I learn the most part?

There are other visualization tools such as QlikView/QlikSense, SAS, Tableau, Sisense, and Looker. I hope I'm not missing anything important and well used in the industry.

I looked up 100 data analyst jobs on indeed, what tools do they use?
