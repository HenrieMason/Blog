Have I been taught the industry standards for data visualization?

Throughout my college experience, I've learned to visualize data using Python libraries, R, Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI. But did I learn the most important tools?

There are other visualization tools such as QlikView/QlikSense, SAS, Tableau, Sisense, and Looker. I hope I'm not missing anything important and widely used in the industry.

Without filtering, I searched for 50 data analyst jobs with the title "Data Analyst." 25 of these jobs were from Indeed, and 25 were from LinkedIn.

It appears that Excel, PowerBi, and Tableau are crutial to know in the Data Analyst space. I only took one Excel class and one PowerBI class in college and I now believe I should've taken more. It suprises me that I did not learn Tableau in college as it's so widely used in the real world. 

For the most part, my college education has given me a great grasp into what most use. Maybe I should learn these others on my own.
