Have I been taught the industry standards for data visualization?

Throughout my college experience, I've learned to visualize data using Python libraries, R, Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI. But did I learn the most important tools?

There are other visualization tools such as QlikView/QlikSense, SAS, Tableau, Sisense, and Looker. I hope I'm not missing anything important and widely used in the industry.

Without filtering, I searched for 50 data analyst jobs with the title "Data Analyst." 25 of these jobs were from Indeed, and 25 were from LinkedIn.

It appears that Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are crucial to know in the data analyst field. I only took one Excel class and one Power BI class in college, and now I believe I should have taken more. It surprises me that I did not learn Tableau in college, as it is so widely used in the real world.

Overall, my college education has provided me with a strong foundation in the most widely used tools. However, I might consider learning these other tools on my own to stay competitive in the industry.
