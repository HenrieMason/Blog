Welcome to Mason's Blog! This article gives a brief introduction into who I am.



I'm Mason Henrie, a 2024 graduate from BYU-Idaho. I studied both data science and finance in college. Here's some quick facts:

I love lifting weights and running long distances. I ran a 50k in December 2023 in Eugene, Oregon.
I love geography and traveling. I can name all 195 countries off the top of my head.
I love cars and automotive. Challenge me by showing a picture of a car, and I will attempt to name the model.
I love designing floor plans. I've created over 10 floor plans on my phone using various apps.
