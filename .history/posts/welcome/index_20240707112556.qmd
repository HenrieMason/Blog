Welcome to Mason's Blog!


I'm Mason Henrie, a 2024 graduate from BYU-Idaho. I studied both data science and finance in college. Here are some quick facts about me:

- I love lifting weights and running long distances. I ran a 50k in December 2023 in Eugene, Oregon.

- I love geography and traveling. I can name almost all 195 countries off the top of my head.

- I love cars and automotive challenges. Show me a picture of a car, and I will likely name the model.

- I love designing floor plans. I've created over 10 floor plans using various apps.
