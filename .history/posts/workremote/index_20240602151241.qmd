I will not pay more than 100k for a home.



It pains me that the average home in my hometown is $399,220. I would much rather build a home on a $5k

The average home value in my home town is $399,220. A property lot in rural arkansas can cost as low as $5,000 with utilities included. If you chose to work an on-site job, you are being forced to buy or rent a home in the surrounding area. If you work remotely, you have the opportunity to live on cheap land with more take-home income. 

It is crazy to me how it's normalized to buy these $400K houses.

In America, less than 1% of people retire before the age of 50. I imagine that the reason for high age retirement is because of high mortgage payments. These mortgage payments act as a siphon for retirement savings accounts. Working remotely can give you the opportunity to minimize spending and increase savings. 

 Would you rather work remotely in rural arkansas or pay an unreasonable amount of cash to live in your hometown?
