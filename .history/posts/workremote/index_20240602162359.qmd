I will not pay more than 100k for a home.



It pains me that the average home in my hometown is $399,220. I would much rather build a small home on a $5k lot in a rural area and live debt free.

Unfortunately, these $5k lots are almost never located near a big city. If they are, they're likely in a sketchy neightborhood or in a greedy HOA.

That's why I belive it's so important to work remote. Working remote can enable the opportunity to buy land in cheap and remote places.

Working on-site will force you to buy an expesnive home in the surrounding area for an outrageous price. Your home loan is likely the largest roadblock inbetween you and your deserved retirement. I don't know about you, but finally retiring at 60 sounds sickening.

To show you that it's possible, let me introduce you to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.

Hot Springs Village is a delightful town exactly 1 hour West of Little Rock, Arkansas. This town has a Walmart, an insane Golf Course, many restraunts, and is situated right in Ouchita National Forest.

All the properties in this area have access to utilities such as water, electricity, and city sewage. Most of these properties are gated with an HOA fee of $49/month which comes with a golf course, tennis courts, a pool, and so much more. I would highly consider this area if I were to work remote.

I hope you now know that a $400,000 home isn't necessary. Look into working remote so a life like this can be possible.
