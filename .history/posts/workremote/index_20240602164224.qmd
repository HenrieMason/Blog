I will not pay more than 100k for a home.



It pains me that the average home in my hometown is $400,000. I would much rather build a small home on a rural $5k lot and live debt-free.

Unfortunately, these $5k lots are almost never located near a big city. If they are, they're likely in a sketchy neighborhood or in a greedy HOA.

That's why I believe it's so important to work remote. Working remote can enable the opportunity to buy land in cheap and remote places.

Working on-site will force you to buy a home in the surrounding area for an outrageous price. Your home loan is likely the largest roadblock between you and your deserved retirement. I don't know about you, but finally retiring at 60 sounds sickening.

To show you that it's possible, let me introduce you to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.

Hot Springs Village is a delightful town located 1 hour west of Little Rock, Arkansas. This town has a Walmart, an insane golf course, many restaurants, and is situated right inside Ouachita National Forest.

All the properties in this area have access to utilities such as water, electricity, and city sewage. Most of these properties are gated with an HOA fee of $49/month, which comes with a golf course, tennis courts, a pool, and so much more. I would highly consider this area if I were to work remote.

A $400,000 home isn't necessary and will . Look into working remote so a life like this can be possible.
