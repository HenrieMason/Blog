    "text": "Welcome to Mason’s Blog! This article gives a brief introduction into who I am.\nI’m Mason Henrie, a 2024 graduate from BYU-Idaho. I studied both data science and finance in college. Here’s some quick facts:\n\nI love lifting weights and running long distance. I ran a 50k in December 2023 in Eugene, Oregon.\nI love geography and traveling. I can name all 195 countries off the top of my head.\nI love cars and automotive. Challenge me by showing a picture of a car and I will attempt to name the model.\nI love designing floor plans. I’ve built over 10 floor plans on my phone via apps."

    "text": "I will not pay more than 100k for a home.\nIt pains me that the average home in my hometown is $399,220. I would much rather build a home on a $5k lot in a rural area and live debt free.\nUnfortunately, these $5k lots are almost never located near a big city. If they are, they’re likely in a sketchy neightborhood or in a greedy HOA.\nThat’s why I belive it’s so important to work remote. Working remote can enable the opportunity to buy land in cheap and remote places anywhere.\nWorking on-site will force you to buy a home in the surrounding area for an outrageous price. Your home loan is likely the largest roadblock inbetween you and your deserved retirement. I don’t know about you, but finally retiring at 60 sounds sickening.\nTo show you that it’s possible, let me introduce you to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.\n\nHot Springs Village is a delightful town exactly 1 hour West of Little Rock, Arkansas. This town has a Walmart, an insane Golf Course, many restraunts, and is situated right in Ouchita National Forest.\n\nAll the properties in this area have access to utilities such as water, electricity, and city sewage. Most of these properties are gated with an HOA fee of $49/month which comes with a golf course, tennis courts, a pool, and so much more. I would highly consider this area if I were to work remote.\nI hope you now know that a $400,000 home isn’t necessary. Look into working remote so a life like this can be possible."
