    "text": "Welcome to Mason’s Blog! This article gives a brief introduction into who I am.\n\nI’m Mason, a certain someone who likes to know everything about everything. I consider myself a geography wizard, challenging me into a geography duel would be the end of your career. I like to think I know every model of any car brand that drives down the road. I like to run, as a matter of fact I just ran a 50k (30 miles) in December of 2023 in Eugene, Oregon. Speaking of Oregon, Oregon’s my origin! I consider myself a proud Oregonian who enjoys the surreal experience of touching the summit of a mountain. If you happen to visit Oregon, I recomend visiting Silver Falls State Park which is east of Salem, Oregon. I also consider myself a lover of Idaho. I’m graduating from Rexburg, Idaho in 3 months and am both happy and sad. Brigham Young University - Idaho has treated me well and has given me an experience to remember. I’m finishing my studies in Data Science and Finance and looking for a Data Analyst position. I have a lot to look forward to. This blog will be epic!"
