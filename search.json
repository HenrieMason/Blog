    "text": "I will not pay more than $100k for a home.\nIt pains me that the average home in my hometown costs $400,000. I would much rather build a small home on a rural $5k lot and live debt-free.\nUnfortunately, these $5k lots are almost never located near a big city. If they are, they’re likely in a sketchy neighborhood or in a greedy HOA.\nThat’s why I believe it’s so important to work remotely. Working remotely can enable the opportunity to buy land in cheap and remote places.\nWorking on-site will force you to buy a home in the surrounding area at an outrageous price. Your home loan is likely the largest roadblock between you and your deserved retirement. I don’t know about you, but finally retiring at 60 sounds sickening.\nTo show you that it’s possible, let me introduce you to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.\n\nHot Springs Village is a delightful town located 1 hour west of Little Rock, Arkansas. This town has a Walmart, an incredible golf course, many restaurants, and is situated right inside the Ouachita National Forest.\n\nAll the properties in this area have access to utilities such as water, electricity, and city sewage. Most of these properties are gated, with an HOA fee of $49/month, which includes a golf course, tennis courts, a pool, and much more. I would highly consider this area if I were to work remotely.\n\nA $400,000 home isn’t necessary and will keep you from retiring early. Consider working remotely so a life like this can be possible."

    "text": "Welcome to Mason’s Blog!\nI’m Mason Henrie, a 2024 graduate from BYU-Idaho. I studied both data science and finance in college. Here are some quick facts about me:\n\nI love lifting weights and running long distances. I ran a 50k in December 2023 in Eugene, Oregon.\nI love geography and traveling. I can name almost all 195 countries off the top of my head.\nI love cars and automotive challenges. Show me a picture of a car, and I will likely name the model.\nI love designing floor plans. I’ve created over 10 floor plans using various apps."

    "text": "Have I been taught the industry standards for data visualization?\nThroughout my college experience, I’ve learned to visualize data using Python libraries, R, Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI. But did I learn the most important tools?\nThere are other visualization tools such as QlikView/QlikSense, SAS, Tableau, Sisense, and Looker. I hope I’m not missing anything important and widely used in the industry.\nWithout filtering, I searched for 50 data analyst jobs with the title “Data Analyst.” 25 of these jobs were from Indeed, and 25 were from LinkedIn.\n\nIt appears that Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are crucial to know in the data analyst field. I only took one Excel class and one Power BI class in college, and now I believe I should have taken more. It surprises me that I did not learn Tableau in college, as it is so widely used in the real world.\nOverall, my college education has provided me with a strong foundation in the most widely used tools. However, I might consider learning these other tools on my own to stay competitive in the industry."
