    "text": "Welcome to Mason’s Blog! This article gives a brief introduction into who I am.\n\nI’m Mason Henrie, a 2024 graduate from BYU-Idaho. I studied both data science and finance in college. Here’s some quick facts:\n\nI love lifting weights and running long distance. I ran a 50k in December 2023 in Eugene, Oregon.\nI love geography and traveling. I can name all 195 countries off the top of my head.\nI love cars and automotive. Challenge me by showing a picture of a car and I will attempt to name the model.\nI love designing floor plans. I’ve built over 10 floor plans on my phone via apps."

    "text": "The average home value in my home town is $399,220. A property lot in rural arkansas can cost as low as $5,000 with utilities included. If you chose to work an on-site job, you are being forced to buy or rent a home in the surrounding area. If you work remotely, you have the opportunity to live on cheap land with more take-home income.\nIt is crazy to me how it’s normalized to buy these $400K houses.\nIn America, less than 1% of people retire before the age of 50. I imagine that the reason for high age retirement is because of high mortgage payments. These mortgage payments act as a siphon for retirement savings accounts. Working remotely can give you the opportunity to minimize spending and increase savings.\nWould you rather work remotely in rural arkansas or pay an unreasonable amount of cash to live in your hometown?"
